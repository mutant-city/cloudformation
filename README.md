### Cloudformation Boilerplate


* AWS has a copious amount of options to sift through for resources and templates which can be time consuming.
* In the spirit of progressive enhancement and iterative development:
    * These templates are meant to be a minimum set of attributes required to perform a specific function.
    * Useful boilerplate for building off of or creating simple resources with mostly defaults.
* Target market for these is hobbyist who need cheap and fast templates to get things done with minimum fuss, or pro's who want a base to extend off of.
